### 1. Blockchain (Back-end)

In Blockchain folder we used the truffle for making the smart contract and migrate these smart contract into the Ethereum virtual Machine.

In this project we used the Ethereum virtual machine becuase if we depolyed the project mean smart contract direct into the main we pay the cost but in development phase the Ethereum virtual machine is best for a developer, so that they can give nine free account with 100 Ether that is used in the Metamask Extension for check the realtime transections.

### 2. Client (Front-end)

Front-end we make in the React.js.
